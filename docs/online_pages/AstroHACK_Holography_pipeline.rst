Holography data reduction pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AstroHACK provides an executable script for the reduction of holography data from the VLA, which is installed by pip somewhere in the PATH. This script has 5 main stages:

#. ASDM import to ms (if data set has not yet been imported to an MS).

#. Calibration of the holography data using CASA tasks (delay, bandpass and phase).

#. Holography processing with AstroHACK (extract_pointing, extract_holog, holog (optionally combine), panel).

#. Data exports generation (Beam plots, aperture plots, zernike fit plots, gains, screw adjustments, etc).

#. HTML report creation (by combining all plots and text products onto a single standalone HTMl to be shared or stored).

This pipeline has been written under the assumption that the user will be running it in CASA or in an environment that provides the casatasks and casatools modules. If casatasks and casatools are not available the pipeline can be run from the extract_pointing stage assuming that the MS is already properly calibrated. The instructions below assume that the pipeline is being run inside CASA.

Pipeline interface
##################

The pipeline has been written with a simple command line interface that expects one mandatory argument from the user, the name of the dataset to be processed (be it an MS or an ASDM). If starting from the calibration stage a reference antenna is also a mandatory argument. Several execution customization options are available, a simple help can be accessed with the ``-h`` flag:

.. code-block::

    CASA <1>: !holography-reduction-pipeline -h

Calibration stage
#################

With a reference antenna chosen it is now time to run the holography pipeline.
The first step of the pipeline is to check whether the data is an ASDM or an MS and if it is an ASDM if it needs to be imported into an MS. With an MS in hands the pipeline proceeds to fetching some metadata from it and then prints a summary of what it has found and which parameters it will use for calibration and further data reduction, e.g.:

    Proceed? <(Y)es/(N)o>:


The check before proceeding can be suppressed by adding the ``-y`` option to the call, e.g.:

.. code-block::

    CASA <3>: !holography-reduction-pipeline otf-ku.ms ea05 -y

The code will then proceed through the calibration steps:

#. Delay calibration with ``gaincal(gaintype="K")``, which is done separately for the two basebands.

#. Bandpass calibration with ``bandpass``.

#. Amplitude and Phase calibration with ``gaincal(calmode="AP")``.

#. Application of all the previously computed calibration tables with ``applycal``.

Holography processing
###################

After calibration the pipeline then proceeds to run AstroHACK's functions:

#. `extract_pointing <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/extract_pointing/index.html>`_: Extract pointing data from the MS onto a ``.point.zarr`` file that is arranged in a convenient way for further processing.

#. `extract_holog <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/extract_holog/index.html>`_: Identify moving antennas from the pointing data, then extract visibilities from the ms for these antennas and finally match the pointing data to the visibilities.

#. `holog <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/holog/index.html>`_: Grid the visibility data onto beam images, then perform a zero padded 2D FFT of the beam images to obtain aperture images, these aperture images are then fitted with zernike polynomials to obtain a description of the macro-scale perturbations of the aperture and then finally a phase model is subtracted from the aperture to account from minor optical misalignments, such as reference pointing errors and being slightly out of focus.

#. Optionally `combine <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/combine/index.html>`_ can be run after holog (``-c``, ``--commbine`` option) to combine the different spectral windows in the aperture plane, this is usually done to increase SNR.

#. `panel <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/holog/index.html>`_: This is the last step of the holography data reduction. Here each pixel of the stokes I image of an aperture is attributed to a panel, and then a surface is fit to each panel to determine how much each screw adjuster needs to be moved in each panel to improve the surface accuracy of the antenna.


By default the AstroHACK stages are run in parallel, (ncores =4), this can be changed by explicitly giving a number of cores e.g. ``--ncores 5``. For a serial run, one should use ``--ncores 0`` or ``--ncores 1``. In case of failures or there is a desire to re-run the pipeline from a particular stage, the user can then use option ``--starting-stage``.
For more details on the holography processing stages there is the more detailed `VLA holography tutorial <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/vla_holography_tutorial.html>`_.

Exports and Report stages
#########################

After the AstroHACK data files are created, the pipeline then proceeds to execute the exporting functions from the associated Python classes:

#. `AstrohackPointFile.plot_array_configuration <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/io/point_mds/index.html#plot_array_configuration>`_: Single plot displaying the array configuration at observation time.

#. `AstrohackImageFile.plot_beams <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/io/image_mds/index.html>`_: Plots of the gridded beam images.

#. `AstrohackImageFile.plot_zernike_model <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/io/image_mds/index.html>`_: plots of the Zernike models of the apertures and the associated residuals.

#. `AstrohackImageFile.export_phase_fit_results <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/io/image_mds/index.html>`_: Produce a small table of the phase fit results when the regular perturbations phase fit mechanism is used.

#. `AstrohackImageFile.export_zernike_fit_results <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/io/image_mds/index.html>`_: Produce a table of the fitted Zernike polynomial coefficients for each correlation.

#. `AstrohackPanelFile.plot_antennas <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/io/panel_mds/index.html>`_: Plots of the antenna apertures, amplitudes, masks, phase, surface deviation, estimated surface deviation corrections and estimated surface correction residuals.

#. `AstrohackPanelFile.export_screws <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/io/panel_mds/index.html>`_: Export a table with proposed screw adjustments as well as a map of the antenna surface with color coded screws to help identifying screws for which there are bigger corrections to be applied.

#. `AstrohackPanelFile.export_gain_tables <https://astrohack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_api/autoapi/astrohack/io/panel_mds/index.html>`_: Create a small table containing estimated antenna gain losses for several wavelengths before and after screw adjustments.

After the production of these export products the pipeline then creates a standalone HTML report with all of them that can then be stored or shared without the need to carry any extra data, an example of such a report can be seen `here <../example-holography-ku-band-report.html>`_.
